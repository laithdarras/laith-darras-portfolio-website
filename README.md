# Laith Darras â€“ Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio built with **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It's deployed on [Vercel](https://laith.vercel.app) and structured as a clean website.

---

## Tech Stack

- HTML + JS (Vanilla)
- Tailwind CSS (v3.x, using CLI)
- PostCSS + Autoprefixer
- Live Server (local dev)
- Deployed via Vercel

---

## Local Development side notes for me

- ALWAYS work inside the `public/` directory when using `live-server` command to view website w/o pushing to production!
- run `npm run build` when ready to deploy
