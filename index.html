                Welcome to my portfolio! I'm an undergraduate at UC Merced, majoring in Computer Science & 
                Engineering with a keen interest in the realms of cybersecurity and software engineering. 
                I'm on a journey to become a software security engineer, and I'm currently 
                enhancing my skills through courses like CodePath's Cybersecurity courses. 
                Join me as I explore the exciting world of technology and its endless possibilities.

                  , I embarked on a data-driven journey. Leveraging Python's data-processing prowess, 
                  I visually deciphered a Customer Support Twitter Dataset, extracting meaningful insights. 
                  My analysis brought forth trends and patterns, empowering data-driven decisions. The outcome? 
                  A dynamic dashboard, meticulously crafted to effectively showcase this information, ensuring 
                  invaluable support for informed organizational choices.</p>

              <p>I collaborated closely with fellow instructors to develop engaging 
                lesson plans that included interactive review activities, hands-on coding challenges, 
                and regular quizzes. These materials were carefully crafted for remote 
                learning, ensuring students' sustained engagement and progress. Taking on 
                the role of evaluator, I assessed the work of a group of 15 elementary 
                students located in Ethiopia. Through this process, I gained valuable 
                insights into their learning journey and provided thoughtful recommendations 
                to support their advancement. As a direct result of these efforts, students 
                achieved the remarkable ability to independently create and program projects 
                using Scratch and Python, even without prior experience in these languages
